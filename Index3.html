      <p>Power Bank</p><br>
 
      <pre>
        Power bank are portable device comprised of a special circuit that control power flow. 
        They allow the storage of electrical energy (i.e. deposit it into the battery bank) 
        and then later use it to charge any mobile device (i.e. withdrawn it from the battery bank).
        Power Bank is also called “plug in battery, external battery and charging battery” of the digital products.
         Power Bank can simple be define as a power storage/energy reservoir for a secondary cell or a rechargeable battery. 
        Power Bank are of different size and capacities e.g.2000mAh,3300mAh,4600mAh etc.
         
        The power Bank is an essential power source for charging the mobile phones which is a part of modern life. 
        Power Bank has made a lot of impact both on human's life as a result of the fact that people find it difficult to do away with their
        mobile devices switch off or drained out while they are away from their home or offices or which can be as a result of outage or interrupted AC power supply. 
        It has also improved the economy tremendously as more people buy it as a necessity for the purpose of charging their mobile devices. 
        This will help in reducing overall cost of the device and also help people in by relaxing the need of phone chargers for USB devices. 
        It will definitely be helpful over the days, as, the speed and advancements in phones are at an exponential rate which decreases the charge of phones greatly.

      <h2><b>MAJOR PROJECT</b></h2><br>
 
       <p>Security System for Vehicle </p><br>
 
       <pre  style="text-justify: auto;">
 
        Driving without driving license is a major issue in many countries. Survey says that the accidents happened mostly 
        by the unlicensed drivers. Owing to unsafe conditions on roads, the rate of accidents has been high.
        Unlicensed driving is a matter of concern for several reasons. It is noticeable that the term “unlicensed” is used
        interchangeably to mean one of the below subcategories, as follows: 
        A) Drivers who drive but who have never possessed any form of license. 
        B) Drivers who have previously held a license but have been disqualified. 
        C) Drivers possessing only a provisional license. 
        Biometric technology is a method that requires the physical presence of the identified person. It is a new 
        method for security systems. Fingerprint recognition is one of the most widely used biometric system and
        also the oldest method which is dated back to 2200 BC. 
        This project  focuses about developing a prototype of vehicle ignition using fingerprint and smart card. 
        This  system includes Arduino, Smart Card (DL), Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) reader, Fingerprint (FP) module and
        Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) modem Global Positioning System (GPS). This system has a potential to avoid
        the vehicle from being stolen.  This lock security is developed to control the ignition of the vehicle by using fingerprint. 
        The existing lock at the vehicle is not highly secured which consist of handle lock. By creating this prototype, security
        level of the vehicle ignition is highly protected and could help to decrease theft. 
        The main idea of this project is a fingerprint scanner will detect the authorized or an unauthorized user and 
        alert the user via GSM. The main objective is to reduce insecurity on the roads created by illegal drivers. 
        Additional goals of this paper are to minimize unlicensed driving; reduce the possibility of fraud, and to increase 
        functionality of DL (payment function,digital signature, penalty point collection).
